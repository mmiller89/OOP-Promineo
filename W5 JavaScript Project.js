// 1.	Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements.
// a.	Use at least one array.
// b.	Use at least two classes.
// c.	Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

//step 1 - Setup, including empty arrays and classes.

//based on the creation method, each new menu name will be index 1, 5, 9, 13 etc. 
//deleting item 1, for example....would require deleting index 0, 1, 2, 3

//Mentor Session Questions:

//1) How can I make this code more readable/clean?
//2) Say I wanted to create another option that the customer could modify the name, description, or price of an already existing item. How would I do that?
